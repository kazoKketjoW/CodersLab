#In the archive/ folder you will find folders 2018, 2019 and 2020, and in each of them folders named with three-letter abbreviations of the English months (jan, feb, etc.).
#
#In each of these folders you will find .csv files that contain information about how many new customers, regular customers and VIP customers visited the store that day.
#
#Write a script that will summarize how many new, regular and VIP customers visited the store in 2018, 2019 and 2020.
